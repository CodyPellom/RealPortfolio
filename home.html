                <p> Hi, I'm Cody Pellom. I'm a full-stack web developer in Atlanta, GA. I'm currenty enrolled as a student in
                        General Assenmbly's Web Development Immersive Program. Programmmic thinking in an Agile workspace
                        has been the primary focus of my WDI cohort along with an intensive focus on best practices, RESTful
                        technique, DRY coding, and hundreds of hours of JavaScript/HTML/CSS/ practice, along with completing
                        projects that drive personal growth as a modern web developer.


                        <br> I specialize in Front-End Development; applying best practices and keeping my code dry is critical
                        in creating a solid framework for any website or application I'm working on. With that said, I also
                        study renown APIs for both ideas and to improve my techniques and best practices.


                        <br> Creating a soid application or website requires a implementing a strong foundation. When working
                        on the Back-End of any project I utilize Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and Handlebars. For JavaScript
                        support, Jquery has quickly become my favorite JavaScript library. Utilizing these tools is the best
                        way to build that solid foundation every great website needs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                        I have a blog on Wordpress called <a href="https://webdevelopersurvivalguide.wordpress.com">The Web Developer's Survial Guide.</a>

                        passion projects and ideas.
